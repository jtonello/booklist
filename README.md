# booklist

This simple PHP program performs a search against the Google Books database using the Google API.

To use this, you'll need to create an account at https://console.cloud.google.com. Go to the Google Cloud Platform library and search for "book." Add that API and set up credentials. Use the key that's generated in booklist.php.

Look for complete details in a coming issue of Linux Journal!
